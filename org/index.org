* Codejam in C 
** Introduction
   My name is Mohamed Fouad, and I am making an opensource book for Google CodeJam, it attempts to explain
   the problems and their analysis, as well as *most compact* implementations in
   the C programming language. It is intended to be printed to a nice
   hardcover book and sold per its printing cost (nonprofit). The idea
   is to make a really cool & neat book for competitive programmers to enjoy.
