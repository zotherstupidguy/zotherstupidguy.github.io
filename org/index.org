* Codejam Qualification Round in C  [%]
** Introduction
   My name is Mohamed Fouad, and I am making an opensource book for
   Google CodeJam, it attempts to show the problems and their
   analysis, as well as *most compact* implementations in
   the C programming language. It is intended to be printed to a nice
   hardcover book and sold per its printing cost (nonprofit). The idea
   is to make a really cool & neat book for competitive programmers to enjoy. 
   Meanwhile I am practicing atlease a codejam contest per day (3 hours each)
   in C and logging my results.

   Problems are grouped based on their difficulity level on which rounds
   they are presented.
