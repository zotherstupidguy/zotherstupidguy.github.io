* Codejam Qualification Round in C  [%]
  My name is Mohamed Fouad, and I am making an opensource book for
  Google CodeJam, it attempts to show the problems and their
  analysis, as well as *most compact* implementations in
  the C programming language. It is intended to be printed to a nice
  hardcover book and sold per its printing cost (nonprofit). The idea
  is to make a really cool & neat book for competitive programmers to enjoy. 
  Meanwhile I am practicing atlease a codejam contest per day (3 hours each)
  in C and logging my results.

  Problems are grouped based on their difficulity level on which rounds
  they are presented.
   
  Total of Qualification Round problems from 2016-2008 is *33 problems*.
  Each problem should be divided into subproblem(s).
