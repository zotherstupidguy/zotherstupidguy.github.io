* Codejam Qualification Round in C  [%]
  My name is Mohamed Fouad, and I am making an opensource book for
  Google CodeJam, it attempts to show the problems and their
  analysis, as well as *most compact* implementations in
  the C programming language. It is intended to be printed to a nice
  hardcover book and sold per its printing cost (nonprofit). The idea
  is to make a really cool & neat book for competitive programmers to enjoy. 
  
  Problems are grouped based on their difficulity level on which rounds
  they are presented.
   
  Total of Qualification Round problems from 2016-2008 is *33 problems*.
  Each problem should be divided into subproblems. Subproblems include
  getting the input correctly using C, consiously storing it in
  appropiate datastructures.

  Competitive spirit is required to maintain discipline intact, as such
  channels as #algorithms@freenode.net are preferred hangout places. 

  Objective is to earn 25points per practice day.
