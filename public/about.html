Hello, I am Mohamed Fouad a.k.a zotherstupidguy, a Software
Philosopher living in Alexandria, Egypt; and this is my day-to-day b(log). 
I am available for [hire [link to google docs resume]].
This is an org-mode generated log (Org-Agenda, Org-Capture, tag-based organization) via those <a href="https://github.com/zotherstupidguy/dotfiles">dotfiles</a>

Why zotherstupidguy nick? it is a joke and a reminder that being smart is totally relevant to my current knowledge circles,
and I must always seek ideas outside of my regular knowledge circles, anything that I am already familair with probably wouldn't breed me 
an <b>orginal</b> idea, I must seek doctrine depth through skeptic breadths!

PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF YOU THINK I AM FUNNY.

<p>
Once in a while, I examine how Top Universities offer their mathematics and computer science related programs. I try to find what kind of books they set as 
textbooks, to go read them on my own, purchase them from Amazon (I only like <b>Hardcover</b> books!), or scout them in the cheap 2nd hand street book markets. 
My act is inspired by <b>“You wasted $150,000 on an education you coulda got for $1.50 in late fees at the public library.” ― Matt Damon, Good Will Hunting</b>. 
I worship those Professors who offer their courses online for free! If it is up to me I build them real-size human sculptures in my City.

My study strategy says that each book, videocourse, etc. is in one direcotry. This is my study log, I keep all the 
knowledge that I aquire into this file, and I organize it accordingly to smallest possible domain of knowledge such as instead of having
a heading for Number Theory, I have multiple headings for topics such as Prime Numbers, that way when I read a book I don't read the chapters but
I explore the glossry and find where my objective topic exists and I write it down based on:

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-6">
<p>
The main idea of Competitive Programming Training is to solve any given problem in under 10minutes, thus the 
most basic studytime unit  is t = 10mins, henceforth all my study and practice activites are divided up in units of 10mins.
</p>

<p>
I categorieze my incoming infromation into 3 categories: 
A. Can,    12 problems, total 12t(2hrs)
B. ZPD,    4 problems, total 12t(2hrs)
C. Can't.  1 problem, total 12t(2hrs)

</ul>
<p>
a score * 0 or * 1 or * 2 / by the number of shit I am trying to accomplish.
</p>


<p>
I start my day trying to attack category <b>C. Can't</b> to fail and study a bit, 
then go for the <b>B.ZPD</b> which is my zone of proximal development, 
with some effort I can succeed in solving a problem in 30mins.
then I end my day with the <b>A.can</b> somthing that I solved before or know I can solve. 
Simple Objectives results in Simple Delights makes me happy at the end of the day. 
</p>

<p>
After Studying or Practice, blog about it using the Feynman Technique,  
</p>

<p>
All problems are solved in C with emacs templates to save time.
</p>

<p>
In order to achieve that training is divided into 3 difficulity/time categories: ZPT0, ZPT1, ZPT2.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>2hrs for <b>one</b> ZPT0 problem, this is a problem that are too difficult to solve and requires significant studying</li>

<p>
to be familiar with the nessesary knowledge domain(s), 
  the 2hours are dedicated for 
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Understanding the problem</li>
<li>Identifying which knowledge domain(s) it belongs to.</li>
<li>Reading about those knowledge domain(s).</li>

Naturally I could write a book or two from the notes I have written into this file. As a matter of fact, I belive that
<b>the only way</b> computer scientets are capable of writing so many powerful books is due to the fact that they use
emacs in a similar way to what I am doing here, I can collect information and tag it, search it easily and update it,
check cross references, etc. <b>It feels Awesome to be that Powerful!</b> I think i will keep taking notes in notebooks and as a review, I 
will transfer the notes to this org document. I expect to be able to have codeblocks, latex formulas and maybe even 
graphs. Eventually I shall publish a series about computer science via <a href="https://leanpub.com">https://leanpub.com</a>, call it "zotherstupidguy computer science notes" 
each volume is small 100pages book of notes and commentary.

<p>
(14 to 32 Hz alert, focused)
Beta is the most common brain wave pattern: Beta brainwaves are produced when we are wide awake, alert, 
active and engaged in mental activity, usually involving more the rational, reality-oriented left hemisphere of our brain. 
When beta wave activity becomes very intense, our brain hemispheres become less synchronized. 
Beta state is required to function properly in your everyday life.

(7 to 14 Hz relaxed yet aware, meditative)
These are lower frequency waves: The state is generated when our thoughts are really not concentrated and our minds wonder freely, 
or we are in a relaxed state such as meditating or daydreaming. We also experience Alpha Brainwaves when we are gently busy i
with routine tasks like pottering in the garden, taking a shower, putting on makeup, doing light housework. 
Alpha is considered to be the bridge between the conscious mind and the subconscious mind.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-9-3">
<p>
(3.5 to 7 Hz deep relaxation, twilight state)
Theta brainwave states have been used in meditation for centuries: It is common for people to feel as if they are in a trance, 
where the mind feels as though it may have gone to sleep although it is conscious of what is happening around it. 
Theta induces a capacity for prolonged daydreaming, where a loss of time may be experienced.
Theta waves are also conducive to visualization and creativity and the mind in this very relaxed state is highly receptive to direct suggestion under hypnosis. As with Alpha, in Theta our brain hemispheres are synchronized and we experience whole brain functioning.

<h4 id="org2b12f1c"><span class="section-number-4">1.9.4</span> Delta brainwaves</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-9-4">
<p>
(0.1 to 3.5 Hz deep sleep )
This is the slowest band of waves that our brains produce and they occur when we are in deep, dreamless sleep. 
These waves are very beneficial for the body which restores and heals itself when in this state. 
The delta state releases anti-aging hormones, including melatonin and DHEA. 
Human growth hormone (HGH) is another anti-aging hormone that is increased when delta brainwaves are occurring inside the brain, 
due to the stimulation of the pituitary gland. HGH maintains the skin, bone density, cartilage, and the joints in your body as 
well as speeds up the healing process of joint and cartilage injuries. HGH can also help heal physical pain.
</p>

<p>
In healthy amounts, delta brainwaves can also cause a person to have an advanced state of empathy, understanding, and compassion for others.
Delta is the place of deepest relaxation, deepest healing, deepest spiritual connection and deepest connection with the subconscious mind. 
It is considered to be the gateway to the unconscious mind and the collective unconscious, bringing access to the universal psyche or mind.

<h4 id="org19dae25"><span class="section-number-4">1.9.5</span> Gamma brainwaves</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-9-5">
<p>
(40Hz or higher: zen mind mastery)
Gamma brainwave states are the most rapid in frequency. 
Gamma hase long been considered the the brainwave that is able to link and process information from all parts of the brain. 
It is the frequency that brings with it the ability to process large amounts of information in relatively small amounts of time. 
Think of generating more Gamma activity as getting a processor upgrade for your brain.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately Gamma brainwaves have received the least attention and research, although more attention is currently being paid to them.
Having high amounts of Gamma Brainwave activity has been associated with:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Having high levels of intelligence</li>
<li>Being compassionate</li>
<li>Having high amounts of self-control</li>
<li>Having greater than average feelings of natural happiness.</li>
<li>Increased awareness through your five senses</li>
<li>Research has indicated at moments when bursts of precognition or high-level information processing occur,</li>
</ul>
<p>
your brainwaves briefly reach the Gamma state.
